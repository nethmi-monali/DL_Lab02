## exercise 02

1. What happens when the number of hidden nodes increases?

     As the number of hidden nodes increases, the modelâ€™s capacity to capture complex patterns in the data also increases. 
     This can lead to improved performance up to a certain point.


2. Can you explain the pattern of the accuracy when the hidden nodes increase?

     Initially, increasing the number of hidden nodes should improve the accuracy because the model can learn more complex features.
     However, after a certain point, adding more hidden nodes may lead to overfitting, where the model performs well on the training data but poorly on unseen data. 
     In this specific case, since we are only checking training accuracy, it might continue to increase but with diminishing returns.
